### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on developing a website.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java and C#.
- 👯 I'm not currently looking to work together
- 🤔 I'm looking for help in learning C#, specifically in developing applications using WPF. I also want to learn ASP.NET.
- 💬 At the moment, I can't assist much as I'm just diving into the world of programming, but I hope to change that very soon.
- 📫 You can reach me at slaventus050313@gmail.com.
- 😄 You can call me Slava, Slaventus, Slavik.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like writing music. I hold the unofficial title of the champion for the most popcorn packs consumed during a single movie at the cinema! 🍿
